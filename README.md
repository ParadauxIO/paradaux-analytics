# Paradaux Analytics 

A custom blog analytics software built for Astro / React using Supabase with Privacy in Mind. 

I'll be documenting this, providing a setup guide and explaining the thought process behind it in a blog post, eventually.
I sorta need this to be done before launching my blog again.

## Todo
- Astro/React client lib -> to actually create the metrics
- Privacy Policy template for users (not legal advice)
- Dashboard to actually see the metrics
